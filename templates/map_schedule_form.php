    <h1>Schedule</h1>
        <p>You are welcome to take CS50x at your own pace, so long as you submit nine problem sets and submit a final project no later than <b>31 December 2014</b>.</p>
        <p>To help keep you on track, allow us to propose a schedule of deadlines for you, if only for a bit of psychological pressure, but <b>you do <u>not</u> have to submit by these dates</b>.  In fact, these proposed deadlines will be extended automatically as time passes.  <b>The only hard deadline is 31 December 2014</b>, by which you must submit nine problem sets and a final project.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_165">Sections</h2>

    <p>Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 90-minute sections led by the teaching fellows.  Sections provide you with opportunities to review the course&#39;s material.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_166">Problem Sets</h2>

    <p>Nine problem sets are assigned during the year.  Each is due via electronic submission anytime before 31 December 2014. <br>
    In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a &quot;Hacker Edition&quot; intended for some students.  Both editions essentially cover the same material.  But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. <strong>To receive an honor code certificate from <a class='notranslate' href='https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx' target='_blank' title=''>HarvardX</a>, you must submit the standard editions of problem sets.</strong>  But you are welcome to do the Hacker Editions for your own edification; it just won&#39;t be possible to submit Hacker Editions for credit (or extra credit).**</p>

    <h2 id="toc_167">Quizzes</h2>

    <p>Unlike CS50 itself, CS50x (the edX version of CS50) does <em>not</em> have any quizzes.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_168">Final Project</h2>

    <p>The climax of this course is its final project.  The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software.  So long as your project draws upon this course&#39;s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you.  You may implement your project in any language(s).  You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the CS50 Appliance.  All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, or that you change the world.  Strive to create something that outlives this course.</p>

    <p>Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project.  Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group&#39;s project.  Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group&#39;s project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project.  A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course&#39;s problem sets.  </p>

    <p>See <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2014/x/project/project.html">http://cdn.cs50.net/2014/x/project/project.html</a> for details.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_169">CS50 Fair</h2>

    <p>Toward the course&#39;s end will be the CS50 Fair, an epic display of final projects online.  As part of your final project&#39;s submission, you will be asked to create a 1- to 2-minute video in which you demo your project for the world to see.  </p>

    <p>See <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2014/x/project/project.html">http://cdn.cs50.net/2014/x/project/project.html</a> for details.</p>

    <h2 id="toc_170">Academic Honesty</h2>

    <p>This course&#39;s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as &quot;be reasonable.&quot;  The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course&#39;s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>

    <p>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.  Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy&#39;s other constraints.  Collaboration on the course&#39;s final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.</p>

    <p>Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable.  If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it.</p>

    <h3 id="toc_171">Reasonable</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Communicating with classmates about problem sets&#39; problems in English (or some other spoken language).</li>
    <li>Discussing the course&#39;s material with others in order to understand it better.</li>
    <li>Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.</li>
    <li>Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the snippets&#39; origins.</li>
    <li>Sending or showing code that you&#39;ve written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
    <li>Sharing snippets of your own code on Reddit or elsewhere so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
    <li>Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course&#39;s own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set&#39;s problems or your own final project.</li>
    <li>Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.</li>
    <li>Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="toc_172">Not Reasonable</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Accessing a solution in CS50 Vault to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.</li>
    <li>Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set&#39;s problem before (re-)submitting your own.</li>
    <li>Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff&#39;s solutions to problem sets.</li>
    <li>Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course&#39;s own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy&#39;s other constraints.</li>
    <li>Giving or showing to a classmate your solution to a problem set&#39;s problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.</li>
    <li>Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.</li>
    <li>Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.</li>
    <li>Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Splitting a problem set&#39;s workload with another individual and combining your work.</li>
    <li>Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.</li>
    <li>Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.</li>
    <li>Viewing another&#39;s solution to a problem set&#39;s problem and basing your own solution on it.</li>
    </ul>
